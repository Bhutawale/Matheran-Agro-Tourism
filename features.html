<h1><u>Agro-Tourism Features</u></h1><br>
<p><strong><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Agriculture</strong> is the backbone of Indian Economy. Around 85 percent of the population
is directly or indirectly dependent on Agriculture and almost 26 percent of India’s
GDP comes from Agriculture. 90 million farmers are dwelling in 6.25 lac villages
producing more than 200 MT of food grains feeding the country. More than a
profession or a business, agriculture is India’s culture. Hence, adding additional
income generating activities to existing agriculture would certainly increase
contribution of agriculture in the national GDP. Serious efforts need to be made in
this direction and Agri – Tourism is one such activity.</font></p>
<br>
<p><strong><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Tourism</strong> is termed as an instrument for employment generation, poverty alleviation
and sustainable human development. During 1999-2000, direct employment
created by tourism was <strong>15.5 million</strong>. Besides, tourism also promotes national
integration, international understanding and supports local handicrafts and cultural
activities. During 2000, the number of foreign tourists that visited India was 26.41
lac. India’s share in world tour market is just 0.38 percent. With this meager share,
foreign exchange earned is Rs.14,475 crores. Turnover in domestic tourism is much
more than this. To promote domestic tourism, thrust areas identified by
Government of India are development of infrastructure, product development and
diversification, development of eco-adventure sports, cultural presentations,
providing inexpensive accommodation, streamlining facilitation procedures at
airports, human resource development, creating awareness and public participation
and facilitation of private sector participation. In this process, important
stakeholders are State and Central department of tourism, Indian Institute of
Tourism and Travel Management, Tourism Development Corporations, foreign
embassies, Travel Agents Association of India <strong>(TAAI)</strong>, Indian Association of Tour
Operators <strong>(IATO)</strong>, Tourists, Transport Operators Association, Indian convention
promotion bureau and Pacific Asia Travel Association<strong> (PATA)</strong>.</font></p>
<br>

<p><strong><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Promotion of Agri</strong> – Tourism involves some more important stakeholders namely
Ministry of Agriculture and line departments at state and central governments and
farmers. Promotion of Agri-Tourism needs conceptual convergence with Rural
Tourism, Eco-Tourism, Health Tourism, Adventure Tourism and culinary adventures.</font>
</p><br>
<p>
<u><strong><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Some of the important advantages of Agri – Tourism are:</font></strong></u></strong><br><br>
<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">1. It brings major primary sector agriculture closer to major service sector
tourism. This convergence is expected to create win-win situation for both
the sectors.<br>
2. Tourism sector has potential to enlarge.<br>
3. Agriculture sector has the capacity to absorb expansion in tourism Sector.</font><br>
</p>

<br><br>
<p><strong><u>
SCOPE OF AGRI - TOURISM</u></strong><br>
<strong>
<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Agri-Tourism has great scope in the present context for the following reasons:</strong><br><br>

<strong>1. An inexpensive gateway -</strong>  The cost of food, accommodation, recreation and
travel is least in Agri-Tourism. This widens the tourist base. Present concept
of travel and tourism is limited to urban and rich class which constitutes only
a small portion of the population. However, the concept of Agri-Tourism
takes travel and tourism to the larger population, widening the scope of
tourism due to its cost effectiveness.<br><br>
<strong>2. Curiosity about the farming industry and life style -</strong> The urban population
having roots in villages always have had the curiosity to learn about sources
of food, plants, animals, raw materials like wood, handicrafts, languages,
culture, tradition, dresses and rural lifestyle. Agri-Tourism which revolves
around farmers, villages and agriculture has the capacity to satisfy the
curiosity of this segment of population.<br><br>
<strong>3. Strong demand for wholesome family oriented recreational activities -</strong>
Villages provide recreational opportunities to all age groups i.e. children
young, middle and old age, male, female, in total to the whole family at a
cheaper cost. Rural games, festivals, food, dress and the nature provides
variety of entertainment to the entire family.<br><br>
<strong>4. Health consciousness of urban population and finding solace with nature
friendly means -</strong> Modern lifestyle has made life stressful and average life
span has comedown. Hence, people are in constant search of pro-nature
means to make life more peaceful. Ayurveda which is a pro-nature medical
approach has roots in villages. Indigenous medical knowledge of villagers is
respected. Organic foods are in greater demand in urban areas and foreign
countries. In total, health conscious urban population is looking towards pronature
villages for solutions.<br><br>
<strong>5. Desire for peace and tranquility -</strong> Modern life is a product of diversified
thinking and diversified activities. Every individual attempts to work more, in
different directions to earn more money to enjoy modern comforts. Hence,
peace is always out of his system. Tourism is a means for searching
peaceful location. Peace and tranquility are inbuilt in Agri-Tourism as it is
away from urban areas and close to nature.<br><br>
<strong>6. Interest in natural environment - </strong>Busy urban population is leaning towards
nature. Because, natural environment is always away from busy life. Birds,
animals, crops, mountains, water bodies, villages provide totally different
atmosphere to urban population in which they can forget their busy urban
life.<br><br>
<strong>7. Disillusionment with over crowded resorts and cities - </strong>In resorts and cities,
over crowded peace seekers disturb each others peace. Hence, peace is
beyond cities and resorts. Even though efforts are made to create village
atmosphere in the sub urban areas through resorts, farm houses, it looks
like a distant replica of the original.<br><br>
<strong>8. Nostalgia for their roots on the farm - </strong>Cities are growing at the cost of
villages. Villagers are migrating to cities in search of jobs and to seek the
comforts of modern life. Hence, yesterday’s villagers are today’s urbanites.
Deep in the heart of urbanites lies the love and respect for their ancestors
and villages. Hence, visit to villages satisfies their desire. This is also
expressed through the hatred of urbanites to flat culture and love for
farmhouses located in the outskirts of cities. Any opportunity to visit villages
and spend time with family is dream of any urbanite. But, minimum decent
facilities are always problem. Agri-Tourism attempts to overcome this
problem.<br><br>
<strong>9. Rural recreation -</strong> Villages provide variety of recreation to urbanites through
festivals and handicrafts. Villagers (farmers) lifestyle, dress, languages,
culture / traditions which always add value to the entertainment. Agricultural
environment around farmers and the entire production process could create
curiosity among urban taught. Places of agricultural importance like highest
crop yielding farm, highest animal yielding farm, processing units, farms
where innovations tried add attraction to the tourists. Agricultural products
like farm gate fresh market, processed foods, organic food could lure the
urban tourists. As result of this agri – atmosphere in the villages, there is
scope to develop Agri – Tourism products like agri-shopping, culinary
tourism, pick and own your tree / plot, bed and breakfast, pick and pay,bullock cart riding, camel riding, boating, fishing, herbal walk, rural games
and health (ayurvedic) tourism.<br><br>
<strong>10. Educational value of Agri-Tourism –</strong> Agri-Tourism could create awareness
about rural life and knowledge about agriculture science among urban
school children. It provides a best alternative for school picnics which are
urban based. It provides opportunity for hands on experience for urban
college students in agriculture. It is a means for providing training to future
farmers. It would be effectively used as educational and training tool to train
agriculture and line department officers. This provides unique opportunity for
education through recreation where learning is fun effective and easy.
Seeing is believing, doing is learning. This experience based concept is the
USP of Agri- Tourism.</font><br><br>

<strong><u>AGRI-TOURISM OPPORTUNITIES IN INDIA</u></strong><br><br>
<strong><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">1. Indian tourism industry is growing @10.1% -</strong> The World Tourism organization
has estimated that the tourism industry is growing at the rate of 4% a year
and that by the year 2010 there will be more than one billion tourists visiting
various parts of the world. But the Indian tourism industry is growing at the
rate of 10% which is 2½ times more that the growth rate at global level. By
introducing Agri-Tourism concept, not only present growth rate is sustained
but also this value addition contributes to further growth.<br><br>
<strong>2. India has entered amongst the top 10 tourist destinations list (Conde Nast
Travellor –</strong> A leading European Travel Magazine) - India is already established
as one of the top tourist destination in the world. Value addition by
introducing novel products like Agri-tourism would only strengthen the
competitiveness of Indian tourism industry in global market.<br><br>
<strong>3. India</strong> has diverse culture and geography which provides ample and unlimited
scope for the growth of this business. India has diverse Agro-climatic
conditions, diverse crops, people, culture, deserts, mountains, coastal
systems and islands which provides scope for promotion of all season, multilocation
tourism products.<br><br>
<strong>4. Increasing</strong> number of tourists preferring non-urban tourist spots (financial
express). Hence, there is scope for promotion of non-urban tourist spots in
interior villages by establishing Agri-tourism centres. But, adequate facilities
and publicity are must to promote such centres.<br><br>
<strong>5. Government initiatives and policies in Xth five year plan allocation has been
increased from 525 crore to 2900 crores.</strong> Increased financial allocation
reaffirms the government commitment. The increased financial allocation
by six times could be used for capacity building of service providers, creation
of infrastructure and publicity.</font>

ISSUES NEEDING ATTENTION FOR THE PROMOTION OF AGRI-TOURISM</strong><br><br>
<strong><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">1. Publicity –</strong> It is difficult to provide publicity to a remote Agri-tourism unit.
Hence, either collectively such Agri-tourism operators can provide publicity or
organizations like ITDC, State tourism development corporations, NGOs,
press and tour operators can take up this responsibility. Information
technology can play very important role in promotion of Agri-tourism. An
interactive website containing all details about Agri-tourism locations and a
toll free 24 hours help line can provide necessary information to Agri-tourists.<br><br>
<strong>2. Transport – </strong>Reaching the remote Agri-tourism units is the greatest challenge
due to lack of approach roads and poor transportation facilities in rural
areas. Tele connectivity is must which is yet to reach villages. Government
should play important role in creating these facilities namely roads, transport
and telecommunication to rural areas especially where Agri-tourism units are
established on priority basis. These efforts could be effective with private
participation in partnership mode.<br><br>
<strong>3. Accommodation – </strong>Safe and clean accommodation is must in Agri-tourism.
Urban and foreign tourists look for these minimum facilities. Orienting Agri
tour operators on one hand and providing incentive to such efforts on other
hand is necessary. Regular clean water supply and neat toilets are
important. At the same time, it is necessary to limit modern facilities in
which Agri-tourist is not interested.<br><br>
<strong>4. Networking –</strong> Networking public and private stakeholders at national and
state level to assist the Agri-tourism operator at remote place is necessary.
This network can get policy support, infrastructure and publicity to Agritourism
units.<br><br>
<strong>5. Capacity building of farmers –</strong> Farmer need to be oriented on maintenance
of facilities, hospitality and public relation which he is not aware<br><br>
<strong>6. Safety of tourists – </strong>Agri-tourism units are located in remote areas which
lacks roads, medical facilities, telecommunication and sometimes threat
from theft and wild animals. Hence, support of local population is must
besides facilities for emergency medical care.<br><br>
<strong>7. Public - Private partnership – </strong>Agripreneurs, farmers’ organizations, cooperatives,
NGOs and agribusiness companies can take up these ventures with the help of farmers and government agencies tour operators.
Transporters and hospitality industry would also benefit in the process.</font><br><br>
